# Image Classifier

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks focused on image classification tasks using AutoGluon.

## Notebooks

1. `clip_zeroshot.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates zero-shot image classification using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training). It covers how to use pre-trained CLIP models for classifying images without specific training on a dataset.

2. `Image_Classifier.ipynb`: This notebook covers general image classification tasks. It includes topics such as data preparation, model training, and evaluation of image classification models using AutoGluon.

3. `image_object_detection.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on object detection in images. It demonstrates how to use AutoGluon for identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image.

## Video Walkthroughs

To help you understand the concepts and implementation details, we've prepared video walkthroughs for each notebook:

These video walkthroughs provide step-by-step explanations of the concepts and code in each notebook.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with its computer vision dependencies.
2. You may need additional libraries like CLIP for the zero-shot classification notebook.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions within each notebook to learn about and implement various image classification and object detection tasks using AutoGluon.
5. Watch the corresponding video walkthroughs for a more detailed explanation of each notebook.

Remember to check the main README of the repository for general setup instructions and prerequisites.
