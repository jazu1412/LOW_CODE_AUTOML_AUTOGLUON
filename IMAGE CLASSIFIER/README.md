# Image Classifier

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks focused on image classification tasks using AutoGluon.

## Notebooks

1. `clip_zeroshot.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates zero-shot image classification using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training). It likely covers how to use pre-trained CLIP models for classifying images without specific training on a dataset.

2. `Image_Classifier.ipynb`: This notebook covers general image classification tasks. It probably includes topics such as data preparation, model training, and evaluation of image classification models using AutoGluon.

3. `image_object_detection.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on object detection in images. It likely demonstrates how to use AutoGluon for identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with its computer vision dependencies.
2. You may need additional libraries like CLIP for the zero-shot classification notebook.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions within each notebook to learn about and implement various image classification and object detection tasks using AutoGluon.

Remember to check the main README of the repository for general setup instructions and prerequisites.
