# Kaggle Competitions

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for Kaggle competitions, demonstrating the use of AutoGluon in real-world machine learning challenges.

## Notebooks

1. `ieee_fraud_detection.ipynb`: This notebook is dedicated to the IEEE Fraud Detection competition on Kaggle. It likely covers:
   - Data exploration and preprocessing of transaction data
   - Feature engineering specific to fraud detection
   - Model training using AutoGluon for identifying fraudulent transactions
   - Evaluation and submission of results to the Kaggle competition

## Getting Started

To use this notebook:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with any additional dependencies required for the competition.
2. Download the competition data from the Kaggle website and place it in an appropriate directory.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to understand the problem, prepare the data, train models using AutoGluon, and generate submissions for the competition.

## Kaggle Competition Participation

Remember to comply with Kaggle's rules and regulations when participating in competitions. Ensure that you understand the evaluation metrics and submission format specific to the IEEE Fraud Detection competition.
