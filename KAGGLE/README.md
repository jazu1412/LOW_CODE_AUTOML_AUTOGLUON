# Kaggle Competitions

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for Kaggle competitions, demonstrating the use of AutoGluon in real-world machine learning challenges.

## Notebooks

1. `ieee_fraud_detection.ipynb`: This notebook is dedicated to the IEEE Fraud Detection competition on Kaggle. It covers:
   - Data exploration and preprocessing of transaction data
   - Feature engineering specific to fraud detection
   - Model training using AutoGluon for identifying fraudulent transactions
   - Evaluation and submission of results to the Kaggle competition

## Video Walkthrough

To help you understand the concepts and implementation details, we've prepared a video walkthrough for the notebook:
