# Tabular Classification and Regression

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various techniques for tabular data classification and regression using AutoGluon. These notebooks cover a range of topics from basic to advanced, including feature engineering, GPU acceleration, and multimodal approaches.

## Notebooks

1. `autogluon_feature_engineering_tutorial.ipynb`: This notebook likely provides a tutorial on feature engineering techniques using AutoGluon for tabular data.

2. `autogluon_gpu_tutorial_ipynb_updated.ipynb`: This notebook probably demonstrates how to leverage GPU acceleration for faster model training and inference with AutoGluon on tabular data.

3. `multi_label_prediction_notebook.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on multi-label prediction tasks, where each instance can belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

4. `Multimodal_Tabular.ipynb`: This notebook likely explores how to combine tabular data with other data modalities (such as text or images) for more comprehensive analysis and prediction.

5. `Tabular_Indepth.ipynb`: This notebook probably provides an in-depth exploration of tabular data analysis techniques using AutoGluon, covering advanced topics and best practices.

6. `tabular_quick_start.ipynb`: This notebook likely offers a quick start guide for using AutoGluon with tabular data, covering the basics of data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with its dependencies for tabular data processing.
2. For GPU-accelerated notebooks, make sure you have the necessary CUDA libraries installed and configured.
3. You may need additional libraries for specific tasks, such as feature engineering or multimodal data processing.
4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
5. Follow the instructions within each notebook to learn about and implement various tabular data analysis tasks using AutoGluon.

These notebooks demonstrate the power and flexibility of AutoGluon in handling tabular data for both classification and regression tasks. They cover a range of techniques from basic to advanced, making them suitable for users of all skill levels.
