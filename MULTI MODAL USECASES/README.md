# Multi Modal Use Cases

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various multimodal learning applications using AutoGluon. Multimodal learning involves combining and processing different types of data (e.g., text, images, tabular data) simultaneously.

## Notebooks

1. `entity_extraction_in_multimodal_ner.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on entity extraction in multimodal Named Entity Recognition (NER). It likely demonstrates:
   - Combining text and possibly other data types for NER tasks
   - Using AutoGluon to process multiple data modalities
   - Extracting entities from complex, multimodal datasets

2. `Image_+_Text_multimodal_(2).ipynb`: This notebook covers multimodal learning with image and text data. It probably includes:
   - Techniques for processing and combining image and text data
   - Building models that can understand both visual and textual information
   - Demonstrating use cases where both image and text inputs are crucial

3. `multimodal_text_tabular.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates multimodal learning with text and tabular data. It likely covers:
   - Methods for combining text features with structured tabular data
   - Using AutoGluon to process and learn from these combined data types
   - Exploring use cases where both textual and tabular information are important

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with its dependencies for computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular data processing.
2. You may need additional libraries specific to multimodal data processing.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions within each notebook to learn about and implement various multimodal learning tasks using AutoGluon.

These notebooks demonstrate the power of combining different types of data in machine learning models, which can lead to more robust and versatile AI systems.
