# Semantic Matching

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various semantic matching techniques using AutoGluon. Semantic matching involves finding similarities or relationships between different types of data based on their meaning or content.

## Notebooks

1. `image_text_matching.ipynb`: This notebook covers techniques for matching images with relevant text descriptions or captions using AutoGluon.

2. `image_text_zero_shot_matching.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates zero-shot learning approaches for matching images and text without specific training examples.

3. `image2image.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on finding similarities or relationships between different images.

4. `text_semantic_search_with_GPU.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates how to perform semantic search on text data using GPU acceleration with AutoGluon.

5. `text_semantic_search.ipynb`: Similar to the GPU version, this notebook covers semantic search techniques for text data, possibly without GPU acceleration.

6. `text2text_matching.ipynb`: This notebook explores techniques for finding semantic similarities between different text inputs.

## Additional Files

- `a1.txt`: This text file might contain sample data or additional information related to the semantic matching tasks.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with its dependencies for computer vision and natural language processing.
2. You may need additional libraries specific to semantic matching and search tasks.
3. For GPU-accelerated notebooks, make sure you have the necessary CUDA libraries installed and configured.
4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
5. Follow the instructions within each notebook to learn about and implement various semantic matching tasks using AutoGluon.
6. Watch the corresponding video walkthroughs for a more detailed explanation of each notebook.

These notebooks demonstrate the power of semantic matching in understanding relationships between different types of data, which is crucial for many AI applications such as information retrieval, recommendation systems, and natural language understanding.
