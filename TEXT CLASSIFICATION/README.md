# Text Classification

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various text classification and natural language processing (NLP) tasks using AutoGluon. These notebooks cover a range of topics including multilingual text processing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and sentence similarity.

## Notebooks

1. `multilingual_text_problem_updated.ipynb`: This notebook likely focuses on handling text classification tasks across multiple languages using AutoGluon. It probably covers techniques for processing and classifying text in various languages.

2. `ner_tutorial_notebook.ipynb`: This notebook provides a tutorial on Named Entity Recognition (NER) using AutoGluon. NER is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, etc.

3. `Sentiment_analysis_and_sentence_similarity.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates two common NLP tasks:
   - Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text.
   - Sentence Similarity: Measuring how similar two sentences are in terms of their meaning or content.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with its dependencies for natural language processing.
2. You may need additional libraries specific to text processing and multilingual support.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions within each notebook to learn about and implement various text classification and NLP tasks using AutoGluon.

These notebooks demonstrate the capabilities of AutoGluon in handling various text-based machine learning tasks. They cover important aspects of NLP, from basic text classification to more advanced topics like multilingual processing and named entity recognition.

Remember to check the main README of the repository for general setup instructions and prerequisites.
