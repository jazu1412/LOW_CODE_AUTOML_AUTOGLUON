# Image Segmentation

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks focused on image segmentation and document classification tasks using AutoGluon.

## Notebooks

1. `beginner_semantic_image_segmentation.ipynb`: This notebook provides an introduction to semantic image segmentation. It covers the basics of dividing an image into segments, where each segment corresponds to a different object or part of the image.

2. `document_classification_budget_email_form.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates document classification, specifically for budget emails and forms. It includes techniques for preprocessing text documents, extracting features, and using AutoGluon to classify different types of documents.

3. `pdf_classification_upd.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on classifying PDF documents. It covers methods for extracting information from PDFs, converting them into a format suitable for machine learning, and using AutoGluon to classify different types of PDF documents.

## Video Walkthroughs

To help you understand the concepts and implementation details, we've prepared video walkthroughs for each notebook:

These video walkthroughs provide step-by-step explanations of the concepts and code in each notebook.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have AutoGluon installed, along with its computer vision and natural language processing dependencies.
2. You may need additional libraries for handling PDFs and other document types.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions within each notebook to learn about and implement various image segmentation and document classification tasks using AutoGluon.
5. Watch the corresponding video walkthroughs for a more detailed explanation of each notebook.

Remember to check the main README of the repository for general setup instructions and prerequisites.
